# Flappy Owl
Flappybird but with an owl

Command-line installation (for power users only, only for Macs):
1. Download the script above to your Downloads folder.
2. Run
```
 sh ~/Downloads/install\ \(for\ macOS\ only\).sh
```
in the Terminal. Or you can just alternatively type "sh " (need a space after it) and then drag the file from a Finder window to the Terminal window.
3. You can now just launch the game from your Applications folder, Launchpad, or Spotlight like normal.
